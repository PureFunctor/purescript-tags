* purescript-tags

A command line tool for generating Emacs tags for PureScript code independent from the `docs`
component of the PureScript compiler. Instead, this project makes use of the [[https://github.com/natefaubion/purecript-language-cst-parser][language-cst-parser]]
package to parse source files into their CST representation and into Emacs tags.
